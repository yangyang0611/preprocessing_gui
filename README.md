# preprocessing_gui
This gui is a no-code preprocessing tools, where user can upload the files and the tool will do the preprocessing automatically

## Upload Folder
Upload a folder include img and label, the label need to follow YOLO label format. There will be a spinner appear when uploading. After successful upload, a pop message will shown up. Also, a `uploaded_dataset` is created at backend.

## Function
1. Resize
2. Rotate 
    a. 90 degree
    b. 180 degree
    c. 270 degree
3. Mirror
4. Add Noise
    a. Gaussian
        i. mean (range -50~50)
        ii. Standard Deviation (range 0~50)
    b. Brightness
        i. Brightness Factor1 (range -50~50)
        ii. Brightness Factor2 (range -50~50)
    c. Saturation
        i. Saturation Factor1 (range 0.0~2.0)
        ii. Saturation Factor2 (range 0.0~2.0)
    The range is recommend range for each noise. When exceeding the value of range, a warning pop message will shown up and input content is clear.

## Add Step Button
After select the functions, press the `Add Step` button. The functions selected will be shown on the  `Processing Step` area. Also, a 

## Processing Steps
You can use drag and drop to adjust the sequence of function steps.

## Proceed Button
Clicked to start the preprocessing, a spinner will shown up indicate the progress is running. Because there are more then one function need to be done, so after one function is finished and move to next function, the data will be save as `temp_process` folder at backend. And after the process all done, the dataset will be save as `processed_files`at backend.

## Download Dataset
This button is hide from click, only when the preprocessing finished, the button can be click. and `processed_dataset` is downloaded in zip format.
